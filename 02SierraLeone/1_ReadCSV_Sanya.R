#ADD UNIQUE PLOT IDENTIFIERS
##########################

# Each plot has unique identifier (id) that consist of cluster and plot numbers.
# Because single field plot id would simplify other computations, we add 
# such id by combining cluster and plot numbers (plot.id = cluster*100+plot,
# e.g. cluster=10, plot=9, plot.id = 1009).

plots["plot.id"] <- plots$cluster*100 + plots$plot
trees["plot.id"] <- trees$cluster*100 + trees$plot 
s.trees["plot.id"] <- s.trees$cluster*100 + s.trees$plot
palms["plot.id"] <- palms$cluster*100 + palms$plot
l.trees.4_10["plot.id"] <- l.trees.4_10$cluster*100 + l.trees.4_10$plot 
d.trees.4_10["plot.id"] <- d.trees.4_10$cluster*100 + d.trees.4_10$plot
d.wood["plot.id"] <- d.wood$cluster*100 + d.wood$plot
